# Hello World! 
It is the first program you should make in any language, so that is what I did!

Piet is a Turing complete esoteric stack-based programming language made to look like a Piet Mondrian painting. It was created by David Morgan-Mar in the 1990s. 

Piet isn't like most languages, rather most esoteric languages. It uses the change in color and hue to determine the next action on the stack. So any change in a piece of the program will change how the rest of the program will look! 

I created this program in https://piet.maurice.me/. It was the easiest Piet IDE that I could find.
It is based on the fork of https://github.com/gabriellesc/piet-ide fixing the image export. You can find it here https://github.com/panmau/piet-ide/tree/fix-export-prq.

If you want to create one of these programs on your own, please look at the documentation, it really helps a lot!

You can find documentation of this programming language from these sites:
 - https://esolangs.org/wiki/Piet
 - https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html

Some sample programs can be found here:
 - https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet/samples.html

Use cases:

 - Build a stronger understanding of programming languages
 - Challenge myself to comprehend difficult concepts.

Problems: 

 - I could have made my program look much more complicated, as seen in some of the example programs.
